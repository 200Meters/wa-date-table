# wa-date-table
Public agencies typically use a fiscal calendar different from the calendar year. In the state of Washington the fiscal calendar is organized into a two-fiscal-year biennium ending in odd years (e.g., Biennium 2123 which includes FY22 and FY23). Each fiscal year runs from July 1st through June 30th. For example, biennium 2123 contains fiscal years 2022 and 2023. Fiscal year 2022 starts on July 1, 2021 and runs through June 30, 2022. Each fiscal year has 12 fiscal months representing the calendar months of the year, but on a fiscal schedule (e.g., July of biennium year 1 is FM01 and June of biennium year 2 is FM 24). 

When dealing with financial data in WA for budgeting, accounting, and treasury purposes, it's important to be able to express the data in accordance with the fiscal calendar. This repository contains both SQL and Power M Query scripts to implement a fiscal date table for Washington State financial reporting and analytic purposes. Note that this is a simple date table for use in reporting cash-based financials. It does not replicate Washington's encumbrance accounting date structures (e.g., AFRS F 25, phase-based cutoffs, etc.), nor does it include operational dates (e.g., it does not account for holidays).
